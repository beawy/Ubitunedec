# Ubitunedec/DecUbiSnd
Ubitunedec, or DecUbiSnd, is a program for decoding and exporting the .SPK audio files found in Ubisoft game .DAT files. Essentially the program can play back and decode sound and music encoded into the game files. 
## Download
To download the GUI version (Windows only), please go to https://github.com/beawy/Ubitunedec/releases/latest and download the .zip file marked GUI.
## Features
- Can import files by large dats such as "fc3_main_english.dat" and pull up all of the sound files within the game (character voices, music, speaking and dialog)
- Can splice all audio together into a WAV file, as well as export individually
- Sorts audio into codecs and identifiers
- Beware, for most games it will bring up around 10k audio files and you have to sort through them manually to find what you need,
## How to use
- Command line (windows):
Run Ubitunedec without any arguments to get a list of command line switches. The Examples directory contains a few examples of usage in the form of batch files.
- GUI version (windows):
Run the .exe file in the GUI folder. Make sure all the .dlls are in the same folder as the exe. Use the program tabs to sort the files and export them.
## Future additions
- I am working on a Linux and Mac port of the program, this will be far off in the future.
- A feature that uses an AI to sort out music from character voices, knowing what the characters are and what they are saying to make it easier for the user to not have to painfully sort through the files.
- Exporting in MP3, OGG, FLAC and M4A formats.
- Having the program include sound files from most Ubisoft games (this could be a copyright issue).
## Licensing
Please use however you'd like, although credit me if you can. I don't recieve royalties, this is open source software.
